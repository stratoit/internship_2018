# SELF DRIVING VEHICLE USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS

This project is an attempt to make a line follower car which can be controlled through an neural network running remotely on a PC. The aim is to make the car usable over all lines and surfaces.
This project was created in the months of May to July 2018, as a part of our internship at Strato-IT.

## Getting Started and Prerequisites

We started out by compiling the project in a python 2 environment on an Ubuntu System, however after facing graphic's driver issues we switched to Windows 10. Make sure you have installed the necessary CUDA drivers and you have tensorflow-gpu and keras installed along with other necessary libraries like opencv 3, numpy, matplotlib etc. If at any time you face an error saying library 'x' is not installed, running your windows terminal as administrator, you could simply do :

```
pip install x
```
Make sure you follow some video tutorial for installing the right combination of tensorflow-gpu, CUDA, CUDAnn and python. CUDA is not open source and tensorflow and python are managed by different communities, so are keras and OpenCV. Using a virtual machine always helps since you never know when you may install something wrong until its too late.
 However we did not use one, but the code would work the same, nevertheless. In case you screw up, be prepare to completely reinstall the operating system. In case the error exists even after reinstalling, you may have to reset your BIOS either physically or via the BOOT menu.

Some errors while compiling may just occur due to changing our version of python, opencv, keras. A simple read of the documentation of your softwares would lead you to the code which would work on your system.

## Checking it out

Instead of providing direct instructions, we have provided instructions in important sub-folders explaining the files in that folder. This folder contains a PDF file **DOCUMENTATION** explaining our project in detail, along with two other folders **USING** (*containing all the important code files*) and **TESTING** (*containing files just used for testing or codes which do not work/are not used/are yet to be fully implemented*).
 Check these folders out. Each of them contains a separate README.md file which will help you further.
