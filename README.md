# SELF DRIVING VEHICLE USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS

This project is an attempt to make a line follower car which can be controlled through an neural network running remotely on a PC. The aim is to make the car usable over all lines and surfaces.
This project was created in the months of May to July 2018, as a part of our internship at Strato-IT.

## Getting Started and Prerequisites

We started out by compiling the project in a python 2 environment on an Ubuntu System, however after facing graphic's driver issues we switched to Windows 10. Make sure you have installed the necessary CUDA drivers and you have tensorflow-gpu and keras installed along with other necessary libraries like opencv 3, numpy, matplotlib etc. If at any time you face an error saying library 'x' is not installed, you could simply do :

```
pip install x
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
